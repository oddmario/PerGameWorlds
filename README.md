# PerGameWorlds

This was my first Minecraft plugin created under the Spigot API

The plugin allows you to restrict access to some (or all) of your worlds to a specific game (either Bedrock or Java).
If it's still not clear to you, this plugin is useful if your server uses GeyserMC and you want to control the way your worlds are accessed per game.

**NOTE:** This plugin uses a hacky procedure (it all might change in the future) in order to achieve its purpose and thus I no longer maintain this project. It is recommended to use the Floodgate API to obtain a more stable solution around the same idea :)

Thanks to @JayieWayie for helping with some functionalities.
